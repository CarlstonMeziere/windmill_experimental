# Felicia Platform - Domain Vision & UI Integration Guide

## Executive Summary

Felicia is a revolutionary work management platform that transforms how organizations handle every type of work - from processing invoices to fixing bugs, from onboarding employees to managing insurance claims. By treating every business activity as a "work item" with customizable workflows, Felicia creates a unified operating system for the entire enterprise.

## Core Concept: Everything is a Work Item

At the heart of Felicia lies a simple yet powerful concept: every piece of work in an organization can be represented as a work item moving through stages. Whether it's an accounts payable invoice, a software bug, a customer claim, or an employee request - they all follow patterns of creation, processing, review, and completion.

## 🏢 Workspace Domain

### Purpose
Workspaces are the highest level of organization in Felicia, providing complete isolation between different teams, departments, or even separate companies. Think of workspaces as separate universes within the platform, each with its own configuration, users, and data.

### UI Vision
When users log into Felicia, they see a **workspace switcher** in the top navigation, similar to Slack or Notion. Each workspace has its own branding, color scheme, and icon. Users might belong to:
- "Accounts Payable" workspace for invoice processing
- "IT Operations" workspace for bug tracking
- "Claims Processing" workspace for insurance claims
- "Admin" workspace for platform administration

The workspace context permeates the entire UI - the sidebar shows workspace-specific navigation, the header displays the workspace name and logo, and all data is filtered to that workspace's context.

### Related Domains
- **WorkspaceAccess** controls who can enter each workspace
- **WorkspaceRole** defines what users can do once inside
- All other domains exist within a workspace context

---

## 📁 Folder Domain

### Purpose
Folders provide hierarchical organization within workspaces, allowing teams to structure their work in ways that match their mental models and existing processes. They serve as both organizational tools and permission boundaries.

### UI Vision
The left sidebar displays a **collapsible folder tree**, similar to file explorers but optimized for work items. Users can:
- Drag and drop work items between folders
- Create nested folder structures (Q1 2024 > January > Week 1)
- See folder-level statistics (15 items, 3 overdue)
- Apply folder-specific views and filters

Folders use familiar icons and interactions - right-click for context menus, shift-click for multi-select, breadcrumb navigation at the top. Power users can save "folder sets" as templates for new projects.

**Folder-Level Permissions**: Users or groups can be assigned as viewer, writer, or admin on specific folders. These permissions gate whether users can exercise their workspace-level capabilities on items within that folder - a Developer can only modify work item types in folders where they have writer or admin access.

### Related Domains
- **Permission** system works through folder-level access controls
- **WorkItem** instances live within folders
- **Client** data might be organized by folder

---

## 💼 Work Item Domain

### Purpose
The Work Item domain is the beating heart of Felicia. Every task, document, request, or process is a work item. Unlike traditional task management, work items are strongly typed - an invoice work item has different fields and workflows than a bug work item.

### UI Vision
Work items appear in multiple contexts throughout the UI:

**List View**: A powerful data grid showing work items with type-specific columns. Invoice amounts for AP work items, severity levels for bugs, claim amounts for insurance items. Users can group, sort, filter, and save custom views.

**Kanban Board**: Draggable cards moving through stage columns. Each card shows type-specific information - a mini invoice preview, a bug priority indicator, a claim status badge.

**Detail View**: Opens as a slide-over panel or full page, showing:
- Type-specific form fields in the main area
- Activity timeline on the right
- Related work items below
- Smart AI assistant panel that can be toggled

**My Work Dashboard**: A personalized homepage showing work items assigned to the user within the current workspace, with priority indicators and due dates.

### Related Domains
- **WorkItemType** defines the structure and behavior
- **Asset** provides file and document management within work items
- **WorkItemRelationship** defines hierarchical dependencies
- **FormTemplate** determines data capture interfaces
- **Agent** provides AI assistance
- **Task** breaks down work items into assignable pieces
- **HITL** handles human-in-the-loop decisions

---

## 🏗️ Work Item Type Domain

### Purpose
Work Item Types are the "classes" that define what kinds of work exist in the system. They establish hierarchies (up to 4 levels deep as a maximum for complexity management, though most organizations use 2-3 levels), data models, workflows, and UI treatments. This is where Felicia's flexibility shines - any business process can be modeled.

### UI Vision
A visual **type designer** interface allows business users to:
- Drag and drop to create type hierarchies (Initiative > Epic > Story > Task)
- Define custom fields using a form builder
- Set up stage workflows with a visual pipeline editor
- Configure automation rules, SLAs, and approval rules
- Preview how work items of this type will appear

The type hierarchy appears as a **filterable tree** in the sidebar when browsing work items. Icons and colors for each type make them instantly recognizable throughout the system. A "type marketplace" might allow sharing type definitions between workspaces.

### Related Domains
- **FormTemplate** defines stage-specific data entry
- **ApprovalRule** sets up standard review workflows
- **Agent** specializes in processing specific types
- **WorkItem** instances belong to types

---

## 📎 Asset Domain (Files & Documents)

### Purpose
The Asset domain is the foundation for all file-based content in Felicia. Files and Documents are simply specialized classifications of assets, each with their own metadata requirements and taxonomies. Users define custom File Types and Document Types that extend the base asset model with required metadata fields, creating a flexible but structured approach to content management.

### UI Vision
**Asset Type Designer**:
- **Metadata Schema Builder**: Visual interface to define required fields for each asset type:
  - Base file metadata (size, type, upload date) is always included
  - Add custom fields with validation rules
  - Set up taxonomy hierarchies for classification
  - Define extraction rules for auto-population

**Asset Classification Interface**:
- **Smart Type Detection**: AI suggests asset type based on content analysis
- **Metadata Form**: Dynamic form showing required fields for the selected type
- **Taxonomy Browser**: Hierarchical picker for classification tags
- **Bulk Classification**: Apply types and metadata to multiple assets

**Asset Discovery & Management**:
- **Faceted Search**: Filter by asset type, metadata values, taxonomies
- **Metadata Grid View**: Spreadsheet-like interface for bulk metadata editing
- **Asset Type Migration**: Tools to change types and map metadata
- **Compliance Dashboard**: Shows assets missing required metadata

**File Type Examples**:
- Invoice (requires: vendor, date, amount, PO number)
- Contract (requires: parties, term, value, expiration)
- Technical Drawing (requires: version, CAD system, scale)

**Document Type Examples**:
- Policy Document (requires: department, effective date, approver)
- Claim Form (requires: claimant, incident date, claim type)
- Specification (requires: product, version, compliance standards)

**Specialized Asset Type Example**:
- Client (requires: company name, primary contact, industry, status)

### Related Domains
- **WorkItem** contains typed assets with validated metadata
- **FormTemplate** can require specific asset types
- **Agent** extracts metadata based on asset type rules
- **Integration** maps external content to asset types
- **AuditLog** tracks all asset operations

## 🔗 Work Item Relationship Domain

### Purpose
The Work Item Relationship domain defines templated hierarchical structures and dependency rules that govern how work items relate to and depend on each other. This enables organizations to model their unique work hierarchies (up to 4 levels deep) with custom terminology and stage-gate logic. Whether it's "Claim → Investigation → Review → Payment" for insurance or "Project → Phase → Deliverable → Activity" for construction, the relationship model adapts to any business process.

### UI Vision
**Relationship Template Designer**:
- **Visual Hierarchy Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface to define parent-child structures with custom names at each level. Start with a blank canvas or modify templates. Name your levels anything: "Case → Subcases → Actions → Steps" or "Contract → Amendments → Clauses → Terms".
- **Custom Terminology**: For each level, define:
  - Singular name (e.g., "Claim")
  - Plural name (e.g., "Claims")
  - Icon and color
  - Whether this level is mandatory or optional

**Dependency Rule Matrix**: Grid showing parent stages across the top, child types down the side, with cells defining required child states for parent progression. Fully configurable based on your stage names and business rules.

**Stage Gate Configuration**: For each parent stage transition, specify:
- Which child types must exist (by your custom names)
- What state/stage children must reach
- Whether all or some children must meet criteria
- Custom business rules using your terminology
- HITL approval requirements between stages

**Example Configurations**:
- Insurance: Claim → Assessment → Repair Authorization → Payment Approval
- Manufacturing: Order → Production Batch → Quality Check → Shipment
- HR: Requisition → Posting → Interview Round → Offer
- Finance: Budget Request → Line Items → Approvals → Allocations

**Runtime Dependency Visualization**:
- **Dependency Graph View**: Interactive diagram showing work items with your custom terminology, color-coded by completion status according to your defined stages.
- **Stage Progression Panel**: Shows current stage (in your terminology), next stage requirements, and a checklist of blocking dependencies using your business language.
- **Custom Views**: Create visualizations that match your industry standards - waterfall for construction, pipeline for sales, case flow for legal.
- **Cross-Workspace Tooltips**: When users work across multiple workspaces, hover tooltips show the mapping between custom terminology and standard terms.

**Smart Dependency Features**:
- Auto-creation of required child items based on your templates
- Business rule engine using your terminology
- Validation against your unique hierarchy rules
- Industry-specific compliance checks

### Related Domains
- **WorkItem** instances follow your custom relationship rules

## 📋 Form Template & Field Domains

### Purpose
These domains enable dynamic, stage-specific data collection without requiring code changes. As work items move through their lifecycle, different information needs to be captured - initial data, review notes, approval decisions, completion details.

### UI Vision
**For End Users**: Forms appear as clean, intuitive interfaces when creating or updating work items. Smart features include:
- Progressive disclosure - only showing relevant fields
- Inline validation with helpful error messages
- Auto-save as users type
- Field dependencies (if country = US, show state dropdown)
- Rich field types (file upload with automatic Asset creation, signature capture, address lookup)
- File upload fields automatically create Assets of the configured type, enforcing metadata requirements at upload time

**For Administrators**: A drag-and-drop **form builder** allows creating forms without code:
- Field palette on the left
- Canvas in the center
- Properties panel on the right
- Preview mode to test the form
- Version history to track changes

### Related Domains

## 🤖 Agent & Agent Context Domains

### Purpose
Agents are AI assistants specialized for specific work item types. Unlike generic chatbots, each agent is an expert in its domain - the Invoice Agent knows about accounting, the Claims Agent understands insurance policies, the Bug Agent can analyze stack traces.

### UI Vision
Agents appear as an **intelligent sidebar** that can be toggled on any work item detail page:
- Chat interface for natural conversation
- Thought process display showing reasoning
- Suggested values highlighted in the form
- Confidence indicators for each suggestion

2. **Intelligence is Embedded** - AI agents assist with every work item type, learning from user corrections and improving over time.

3. **Automation is Accessible** - Visual flow designers and form builders empower business users to automate their own processes.

4. **Work Flows Naturally** - Items move through stages, tasks get assigned, notifications keep everyone informed, and analytics show what's working.

5. **Integration is Seamless** - External data flows in through integrations and webhooks, work gets done in Felicia, and results flow back out.

6. **Security is Invisible** - Permissions just work, secrets stay secure, and audit trails capture everything without getting in the way.

### The Power User Journey
An AP clerk logs in, sees their "Invoices to Review" task list, opens an invoice work item where the AI has already extracted all the data, makes a few corrections, approves it, and moves on to the next one. Behind the scenes, flows are validating data, integrations are syncing with the ERP, metrics are being captured, and the entire process that used to take 15 minutes now takes 2.

### The Administrator Journey  
A process owner uses the visual designers to create a new work item type for vendor onboarding, builds forms for each stage, sets up approval rules, configures the AI agent with examples, creates flows for background checks, and rolls it out to their team - all without writing code.

### The Executive Journey
A department head views their analytics dashboard showing processing times down 60%, accuracy up to 99%, and employee satisfaction rising as mundane tasks are automated. They drill down to see exactly which processes are working well and which need attention.
