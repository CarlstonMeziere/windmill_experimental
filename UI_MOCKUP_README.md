# Felicia UI Mockup - Task Management System

## Overview

This task management system helps coordinate the development of the Felicia UI mockup across multiple developers and AI agents. It uses a hierarchical task structure that mirrors the Felicia platform's own work item concept.

## Files

- **UI_MOCKUP_TASKS.md** - The main task hierarchy file containing all 985 tasks (including review checkpoints)
- **task_tracker.py** - Python script for tracking progress and managing tasks
- **renumber_tasks.py** - Utility to renumber tasks (used to implement 10-increment system)
- **REVIEW_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md** - Template for conducting human reviews
- **UI_REVIEW_PROCESS.md** - Detailed guide for the review process
- **add_review_checkpoints.py** - Script that added review tasks to the hierarchy

## Task Numbering System

All tasks use increments of 10 to allow easy insertion of new tasks:
- Level 1 (Domains): 10, 20, 30, 40...
- Level 2 (Features): 10.10, 10.20, 10.30...
- Level 3 (Components): 10.10.10, 10.10.20, 10.10.30...

Note: Not all branches require the same depth. Some may have 2 levels, others 3.

## Task Structure

Each task includes:
- **Unique ID** - Following the numbering pattern
- **Checkbox** - [ ] for incomplete, [x] for complete
- **Description** - Clear description of what needs to be done
- **Context** - Parent tasks provide context for subtasks

### Review Checkpoints
Human review checkpoints are systematically placed after each major component group (numbered with +5 offset, e.g., 30.15 after 30.10). These ensure:
- Visual consistency with the design vision
- Proper functionality and user experience
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization
- Opportunity for iterative feedback

## Using the Task Tracker

### View Summary
```bash
python3 task_tracker.py summary
```
Shows overall progress, breakdown by level and domain.

### Find Next Tasks
```bash
python3 task_tracker.py next --limit 10
```
Lists the next actionable tasks (leaf nodes that aren't complete).

### Mark Task Complete
```bash
python3 task_tracker.py complete --task-id 10.10.10
```
Marks a task as complete. Will fail if the task has incomplete children.

### Validate Completion Rules
```bash
python3 task_tracker.py validate
```
Checks that no parent tasks are marked complete while having incomplete children.

### Export Status
```bash
python3 task_tracker.py export --output task_status.json
```
Exports the current task status to JSON for programmatic use.

## Task Assignment Guidelines

When assigning tasks to developers or AI agents:

1. **Start with leaf tasks** - Only tasks without children can be worked on directly
2. **Check dependencies** - Some tasks may depend on others being completed first
3. **Maintain consistency** - Review sibling tasks to ensure consistent implementation
4. **Update immediately** - Mark tasks complete as soon as they're done

## Domain Breakdown

The mockup is organized into 16 major domains:

1. **Infrastructure Setup (10)** - Development environment
2. **Core Layout System (20)** - Base UI structure
3. **Workspace Domain (30)** - Multi-tenant workspaces
4. **Folder Domain (40)** - Hierarchical organization
5. **Work Item Domain (50)** - Core work management
6. **Work Item Type Domain (60)** - Type configuration
7. **Form System Domain (70)** - Dynamic forms
8. **Agent Domain (80)** - AI assistance
9. **User & RBAC Domain (90)** - Access control
10. **Asset Domain (100)** - File management
11. **Client Domain (110)** - External entities
12. **Flow Designer Domain (120)** - Visual automation
13. **HITL Domain (130)** - Human decisions
14. **Integration Domain (140)** - External systems
15. **Analytics Domain (150)** - Business intelligence
16. **Final Integration (160)** - Assembly and deployment

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Complete Infrastructure First** - Tasks 10.x.x must be done before any UI work
2. **Build Core Layout Next** - Tasks 20.x.x provide the foundation
3. **Implement Domains in Order** - Earlier domains often provide components for later ones
4. **Mock Data Per Domain** - Each domain has a mock data section (x.40 or x.50)
5. **Review at Checkpoints** - Complete human review tasks (x.x5) before proceeding
6. **Test Incrementally** - Don't wait until the end to test interactions

## Review Process

Human reviews are critical quality gates:
1. **When**: After completing all tasks in a component section
2. **Who**: Product owner, UX designer, or technical lead
3. **What**: Use REVIEW_CHECKLIST_TEMPLATE.md to ensure consistency
4. **How**: Can be synchronous (screen share) or asynchronous (deployed preview)
5. **Outcomes**: Approved, Approved with Changes, Needs Revision, or Blocked

See UI_REVIEW_PROCESS.md for detailed review guidelines.

## For AI Agents

When working on tasks:
- Read the parent task description for context
- Check sibling tasks for patterns to follow
- Use TypeScript interfaces from mock data tasks
- Ensure all components are responsive
- Include loading and error states
- Follow React and Tailwind best practices

## Progress Tracking

The system enforces hierarchical completion:
- Level 3 tasks can be marked complete independently
- Level 2 tasks require ALL Level 3 children complete
- Level 1 tasks require ALL Level 2 children complete

This ensures no task is forgotten and the mockup is truly complete when all Level 1 tasks show as done.

## Getting Started

1. Run `python3 task_tracker.py summary` to see current status
2. Run `python3 task_tracker.py next` to find tasks to work on
3. Choose a task and implement it
4. Run `python3 task_tracker.py complete --task-id <ID>` when done
5. Repeat until the mockup is complete!

## Example Workflow

```bash
# See what needs to be done
$ python3 task_tracker.py next --limit 3

# Work on setting up the React project
$ npm create vite@latest felicia-ui -- --template react-ts
$ cd felicia-ui

# Mark the task complete
$ python3 task_tracker.py complete --task-id 10.10.10

# Check overall progress
$ python3 task_tracker.py summary
```
